* About This Repository
This repository collects most of my course materials for /Hacking History/ a year-long 4th-year seminar I teach in the History Department at University of Toronto.  The repository contains most of my notes and assignments, as well as the syllabus and some auxiliary materials.

The documents in this repository have been written in the [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Introduction][org-mode]] syntax, a textual markup language similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown][Markdown]] only way better in pretty much every way. They've been written so that they export easily to several formats but especially to the Markdown flavour used by [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], which I use to generate the course website. The site generation process is simple but involves a couple of steps; I hope to document it here soon. The final course structure looks a little different from the structure of this repository, and relies to some extent on sophisticated features of org-mode and the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] text editor. As soon as I have everything properly automated and cleaned up, I will post a full set of instructions here.  Meanwhile, feel free to browse [[http://www.hackinghistory.ca/][the course website]] which reproduces many (but not all!) of the materials featured here.
