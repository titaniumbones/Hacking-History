Dear Ms. Sadlier,

Alissa Trotz form Women's Studies at University of Toronto thought you might be interested in a project I'm undertaking at the History Department on the downtown U of T campus.  I'm teaching a course this year (Sept. - Apr.) in which a small group of students will learn how to use an array of digital media technologies, then partner with a community group to create a website or other digital artifact for that organization.  Students will work a minimum of 8 hours/ week in the second term of the academic year on a project 
(a) which is historical in nature, 
(b) in which the organization takes a genuine interest
(c) which the organization is willing to host and in some cases maintain after the student has finished his or her work.  
In most respects this is a form of volunteer labour that the student provides to the organization, but we do ask that the organization provide enthusiasm, guidance, and critique to help students complete their work.  The point is to produce a piece of work that is of genuine service to the partnering organization, and which will endure for some time beyond the student's classroom activities.  In this way students have an opportunity to engage productively with the surrounding community as part of their undergraduate training.  

The course is just starting out right now and I am on the hunt for community organizations who might be interested in putting 1-3 students to work on a project that falls within those parameters, from January to early April of next year.  Do you think you might be interested in working with us?  If so, please, take a look at the course website (http://www.hackinghistory.ca/) and especially our community partner pages (http://www.hackinghistory.ca/partners/).  If you're interested, write or phone me back (ph:647-402-8194) or fill out the contact form (http://www.hackinghistory.ca/contact/).  The course is just piloting this year and we don't have that many students; but this is part of a somewhat larger project and we are trying to collect a substantial database of possible partners for coming years.  So even if your real need is further down the road we would still be eager to have your ideas in our archive. 

Thanks for your time, and of course I welcome any questions.  Best wishes,

Matt Price
History Dept, U of T
