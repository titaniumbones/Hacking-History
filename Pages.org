As we go through the year, you'll need to learn about some or all of these tools.  Explore them when you have a chance
** A laptop
This course is *MUCH* easier if you have a laptop. If you don't own one, you can still do well, but the work becomes much more strained.  A tablet is much harder to work with, and many of the tools described below do not work properly on mobile devices.  Please see me if you don't have one. 
** Firefox and Chrome Dev Tools
Chrome is by far the most popular browser in the world, while Firefox is by far the most open. Both have highly developed *developer tools* with which you should familiarize yourself. As you learn more about web design, you'll come to rely on these tools more and more. Follow these links for more about [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector][Firefox Dev Tools]] and [[https://developer.chrome.com/devtools][Chrome's version]].
** Atom Text Editor
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5cb16a33-f9a5-41d0-862a-2d8367624f6e
:END:
You will be editing code in this class, and for that you need a text editor. If you already have one you love, stick with it; but if you're new to code editing, you should use the class standard, [[https://atom.io/][Atom]].  Download Atom and, once you've read Chapter One of the [[http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/][Manual]], go ahead and [[http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/][install]] the "atom-html-preview", "open-in-browser" and "emmet" packages by navigating to Edit \rarr Preferences \rarr + Install.  There are hundreds of other packages to install if you like.  

Later, you will also want the "linter" and "linter-jshint" packages; you might as well install them now. You will also need "remote-edit" for your class project, in the second semester.  
** Github
Almost all of my course materials are shared on Github, and we'll be learning how to use the underlying git protocol over the course of the semester.  If you want to make things easier on yourself, you can try using the [[https://desktop.github.com/][Github desktop Client]].  
** FTP and/or SSH clients
You'll need a way to move files between your laptop and the server.  Atom will do much of this, but an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:SFTP_clients][SFTP client]] may be of use on certain rare occasions.  I personally use the command line, sort of [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11822192/ssh-scp-local-file-to-remote-in-terminal-mac-os-x][like this]]. 
** Zotero
In the course of your research projects you will accumulate lots of sources, just as you would in a normal research project. These days, we find most of our sources on the web, but older techniques for managing sources -- notecards & so forth -- don't integrate easily with this workflow.  [[http://zoteor.org][Zotero]] is a great bibliographic tool that will help you manage all of your references from your web browser, and will also let you easily drop them into your documents in Microsoft Word or LibreOffice.  If you want to update a reference, or completely change the style of your citations (from MLA to Chicago Manual of Style, vice-versa, or into any of several hundred freely-available journal styles), you can do that, too, at the click of a button.  You can also share references with each other or with others using Zotero groups.  To get started:
- [[http://www.zotero.org/download/][Download Zotero]]. Be sure to download both the Zotero program and the connector for MS Word or Libreoffice/OpenOffice, depending on which you need. If you generally use another program, like Scrivener, you will need the [[http://zotero-odf-scan.github.io/zotero-odf-scan/][RTF scanner]]. Make sure you also get the browser connectors for Chrome and Safari, if you use those browsers.
- Read the [[http://www.zotero.org/support/][documentation]] and/or [[http://www.zotero.org/support/screencast_tutorials][watch the screencasts]]
- flow like a ninja around all your citation needs.
- Join the [[https://www.zotero.org/groups/1658543/kcc-project][class bibliography group]] and please add your sources there.  
** Dropbox or alternative.  
You will often need to share files with each other. For this a service like [[http://www.dropbox.com][Dropbox]] is essential.  Get it, use it, love it.  If you're uncomfortable with Dropbox's (awful) security paradigm, consider using [[https://spideroak.com/][spideroak groups]], or one of the many other competitors.  
** Coding resources
Most of the technical skills you'll learn in this class you can teach yourself (that's mostly how I did it).  Here are just a few links to get you started; there are many, many other options:
- HTML:
  - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html][MozDev Links Page]]
  - [[http://w3schools.com/html/default.asp][w3schools HTML tutorials]]
- Javascript
  - [[http://www.w3schools.com/js/][W3 Schools Javascript tutorial]]

This year-long course examines the relationships among academic history, digital media, and community formation using a variety of texts and methods; it culminates in an intensive semester-long digital storytelling project focused on community engagement. The intellectual focus of the first semester is two-fold: first, on the history of the public sphere and second, on the politics of “engaged” scholarship. At the same time, students will be exposed to techniques of multimedia and nonlinear storytelling. The second semester revolves around a group project undertaken in concert with a community organization. Working closely with their community partners, students will build a digital archive or storytelling framework using multimedia and/or social networking technologies. The fundamental aim of the course is to expand the reach of historical scholarship outside of the academy, and to develop modes of historical research compatible with community engagement. 

Registration for the class takes place through [[https://www.rosi.utoronto.ca/main.html][ROSI]].

** COURSE TITLE: Hacking History
On behalf of the Department of History at the St. George campus of the University of Toronto, we would like to invite you to participate as a partner for a fourth-year undergraduate course, “Hacking History”  during the 2010-11 academic year.  
** About “Hacking History”
“Hacking History” is an experiment in digital community, in which students spend their first semester learning how to tell stories and convey historical information through digital media, and then apply that knowledge in the second semester through collaboration with a community organization.  Students will learn about the history of the world-wide web and how it has changed the way that knowledge is produced and accessed.  They will also learn basic techniques of digital and multimedia storytelling, including topics such as web design and oral history.  The service-learning placement in the second semester is crucial to the objectives of the class, as students will use their new skills to build a substantial historical website or exhibit.  The course has as one of its primary objectives to help build bridges between the University and community organizations, making the history Department's expertise available to a wider public, while at the same time making the public's own knowledge and experience more accessible to students and teachers at U of T.  

** Service-Learning Placements
Our students are history majors with well-developed research, writing, and design skills.  They can offer you, the community partners, assistance in conceptualizing and bringing to fruition projects of a historical nature that can both serve your community and raise your organization's profile on the world-wide web.  Ideally, organizations will find our students capable and enthusiastic partners in the exploration of your community's history.  Our students will take this opportunity to hone their skills and work on a project of enduring value.  They will be evaluated both on the final collaborative product and on their regularly-produced reflections on the experience.  The objective of the placement is to give students real-world experience in the application of the skills they have learned in class and in the course of their undergraduate training, while at the same time encouraging them to find ways to participate in civic society and self-education for the rest of their lives.
** The Students
The course enrols a maximum of 16 students who can be assigned individual or group placements.  Students are expected to complete at least 4-6 hours of service work – mostly research and development of the final product – starting January 3 and ending April 8, but will begin planning their projects much earlier, certainly by the end of October.  Students can work individually or in groups of 2-4 persons.  Community partners are invited to contact us with their ideas at the addresses below and/or fill out our web contact form.  We welcome any and all ideas, with the sole restriction that organizations must have the financial resources to support projects once they are completed (by hosting websites, staging exhibitions, etc), and the enthusiasm to offer thematic guidance to students as they work.

** Sample Project Ideas
+ Your organization serves an immigrant community with a wealth of stories about the migration experience.  Hacking History students can help you collect those stories, place them in the context of changing political and economic conditions in Canada and the country of origin, and build an oral history website to make all of this information accessible to your community and the broader public.
+ Your organization serves a neighbourhood of Toronto.  Hacking History students can research the neighbourhood's history and build a 'locative' web exhibit that links map locations to important events in the neighbourhood's formation. 
+ Your organization itself has a long and storied past.  Our students can help research that history and make it available on the web.
+ You are already working on a large-scale historical documentary or other project.  Our students can help you with research, scripting, and an accompanying website.

*** Example: Neighbourhood Under a Microscope
Last year, three students worked together to create "[[http://microscope.hackinghistory.ca][Neighbourhood under the Microscope]]", a website to acocmpany the highly successful Tornto Archives program of the same name.  Working closely with the archivists, they created a resource which is moree than just a guide to this fantastic archival experience; it also explores the history of [[http://microscope.hackinghistory.ca/other-communities/][The Ward]], Toronto's vanished downtown community, home to many immigrant groups over the last 150 years.  Historical photos are placed [[http://microscope.hackinghistory.ca/?post_type%3Dhistorical-images&p%3D225][in geographical context]], helping modern viewers understand their relation to the past.  All of this was done at thee initiative of our students.  Ask  the archivists how much they love the site!  This is the sort of project we want to do more of here at Hacking History.

* COMMENT DEPRECATED: Old Listo f possible partner organizations

Listed below are some ideas for possible projects, suggested by community organizations.

*** [[http://www.mhso.ca/][Multicultural History Society of Ontario]] 

Contact: [[mailto:britt.braaten@mhso.ca][Britt Braaten]]

Since 2004, the MHSO has operated an [[http://www.mhso.ca/museum.html][Oral History Museum]] (OHM), which features 4 computer-based modules with text, video, audio and image components. At present, the OHM is only accessible by visiting the MHSO's office in the Columbus Centre (901 Lawrence Ave. West). 

The proposed project would involve creating an online version of the OHM, adapting the existing modules where appropriate, and creating new content as desired. The resulting site would feature digitized materials in the MHSO collection in a way that supports our goal of promoting the positive aspects of living in a multicultural province.

*** [[http://www.toronto.ca/archives/][Toronto Archives]] "The Ward"

Contact: [[mailto:jehrenw@toronto.ca][Jessica Ehrenworth]]

The Toronto Archives runs a successful program for high school students in which the students learn about the history of "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ward,_Toronto][The Ward]]" through maps, photographs, and other archival sources. Students working on this project would supplement that realspace program with a website, whose shape and precise function is still to be determined.  The Archive will not be able to act as a formal sponsor of the research, but we can host the project on our server, at least in the medium term. The archive's collection can be [[https://gencat4.eloquent-systems.com/webcat/request/DoMenuRequest?SystemName=City+of+Toronto+Archives&UserName=wa+public&Password=&TemplateProcessID=6000_1580_11104&bCachable=1&MenuName=City+of+Toronto+Archives&eloquentref=toronto][searched online]], and there is also the [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/torontohistory/][flickr stream]], but neither mentions the Ward collection prominently. 

*** Marcus Garvey Anniversary Project

A loose group of intellectuals has expressed interest in a site to commemorate marcus Garvey's 125th anniversary, esp. in regards to his Toronto presence; this is of great interest to me but I'm still awaiting further details.

*** Mississauga Heritage

James -- More info on this?
