"In what ways can digital media and digital networks allow us to do our work as historians better?" -- Cohen & Rosenzweig

* _Introduction_ 
This year-long course examines the relationships among academic history, digital media, and community formation using a variety of texts and methods; it culminates in an intensive semester-long digital storytelling project focused on community engagement.  The intellectual focus of the first semester is two-fold: first on the history of the public sphere, and second on the politics of "engaged" scholarship.  At the same time, students will be exposed to techniques of multimedia and nonlinear storytelling.  The second semester revolves around a group project undertaken in concert with a community organization.  Working closely with their community partners, students will build a digital archive or storytelling framework using multimedia and/or social networking technologies.  The fundamental aim of the course is to expand the reach of historical scholarship outside of the academy, and to develop modes of historical research compatible with community engagement.
* _Course Structure_
** First Semester
In the first semester we will meet on a weekly basis to discuss the week's readings ("Readings" in the [[Outline: Semester 1][outline]]) and work together on a technical or interpretative task that will be defined in advance ("Lab" in the [[outline1][outline]]).  In advance of the class meeting students will (where not otherwise noted) be expected to produce written responses to the readings in the form of blog postings, and to respond to the postings of at least two other students.  In certain weeks there are other types of assignments; these are noted in the outline and referred to in the course requirements.  In general the aim is to foster an atmosphere of collaborative and self-directed learning in which all work is focused on building the analytic resources, technical skills, and confidence to create really great projects in the second semester.  Though the assignment structure is fixed, readings may change based on student interests.
** Second Semester
In the second semester it is expected that students will spend most of their time working directly on their project with the partnering organization.  We will meet most weeks to discuss specific technical questions raised by the projects themselves, and will discuss additional readings as needed.  Importantly, students will continue to make regular postings about their progress, and comment on each other's writing.  In general, it is expected that the second-semester projects will also be collaborations.  
#<<Course Requirements>>
* _Course Requirements_
The class has 4 kinds of assignments:
1. 20 Weekly blog postings (both semesters, 25%) 
2. 4 STA's (first semester, 10%)
3. one written paper (8 pp, 2nd week of semester 2, 10%)
4. The Final Project (website, primarily semester 2, 45%)
with the balance of 10% for on- and off-line participation, which includes comments on other students' blog posts, contributions to delicio.us and Zotero resources, and discussion..  

*Blog Postings* are thoughtful pieces, 00 words or so in length, posted to the course blog by noon the day before class meets.  You will be expected to read your colleagues' work and respond to them, both online (using the blog's comment function) and in class.  In the first semester, these postings will primarily be /responses to the weekly readings./ In the second semester, they will instead generally take the form of /progress reports/ in which you discuss your final projects and your interactions with partnering organizations.  In the event that I want you to focus on something else, I will inform you one week in advance /in class/.  Some informality in tone is acceptable, but these are to be serious, thoughtful engagements with the course materials.  Citations of online sources should use hyperlinks; other material should be cited as in printed assignments.  See the blog style guidelines for more detail.  

*Short Technical Assignments (STA's)* are designed to give you the technical skills you will need for your website development work in the second semester.  Approximately every 2 weeks in the first semester, you will complete a short on or off-line assignment for a pass-fail grade.  The lab assignments will cover basic web design skills and other technical issues. These and other topics will be covered in the third 'lab' hour of class. 

*The paper* is due shortly after the beginning of the second semester.  Approximately 7-8 pages long, its format is that of a standard course paper:  a well-researched thesis, supported by evidence garnered from primary and secondary sources.  Students are expected to write on topics related to their *Final Projects* (see below).  

*The Final Project* is a major collaborative effort to build a historical website in service to an organization outside the University.  Students will work in groups of 2-4, collaboratively building a substantive site which balances scholarly merit with the interests of the sponsoring organization and accessibility to the general public.  We have assembled a list of [[./PartneringOrganizations.html][Partnering Organizations]] which have expressed interest in working with you, and you should carefully examine their proposals and discuss them with your peers.   See the [[./ProjectGuidelines.org][Project Guidelines]] for more detailed discussion & marking breakdown.  

** Grading of Posts and STA's
Posts and labs will be graded in the old-fashioned 0-4 system, where 0 represents and F and 4 an A.  The assignments will be summed and averaged, then converted to a UofT-style numerical grade.  
** Late Policy
*Blogs:* blog postings are due by noon /the day before class/. Late blog postings will not be marked.  
*STA's:* 5%/day late penalty for the first 4 days, after which they will not be marked.
*Paper:* 3%/day
*Final Project:* It is /essential/ that you complete your final project on time in order to get feedback from the sponsoring organization and organize the handoff of the project.
