#+ATTR_HTML: :class org-upload
[[file:Images/matt_on_desk_for_web.jpg]]
In the year of your birth, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web#1979.E2.80.931991:_Development_of_the_World_Wide_Web][World Wide Web]] was an obscure technical work-in-progress buried in the depths of a vast research institute.  Today, it permeates almost every aspect of our lives, including every stage in the production of knowledge.  You have been living through a fundamental transformation of knowledge; and yet the modes of communication you've learned and explored at University (the essay, the article, the scholarly monograph) belong to the world that came before.  There are good reasons for this.  The standards of our discipline were formed carefully over hundreds of years, in a determined quest to uncover and communicate truths about the past to our colleagues and the wider world.  Even so, historians need to explore the digital media of our present and future.  The books and other writings of old will not disappear, but they will be supplemented and to some extent supplanted by the new media of the web and its successors.  In this class, we will explore those new media as tools for the transmission of historical knowledge, culminating in an intensive group project in which you will build a historical website in close collaboration with a community partner.  The community partnership is a key element of "Hacking History", and a source of many of its pleasures and challenges.  

Along the way, we will learn about the history of digital media, and their place in the development of the public sphere; and we will also study the history and politics of "engaged" and "public" scholarship.  We will also spend a substantial amount of time acquiring the technical skills needed for a project like this, e.g., the fundamentals of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] and [[http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript][Javascript]], as well as just enough [[http://ca.php.net/tut.php][PHP]] to work with the [[http://www.wordpress.org][Wordpress]] Content Management System.  No prior technical knowledge is required for this, but you will need to be willing to challenge yourself to learn a few tricks and principles of web programming.  The payoff for that effort is huge: a chance to contribute in a meaningful way to historical discourse beyond the walls of the University, and to explore the frontiers of historical communication in the process.  

In 2017-17, we have a very small class size, so we will likely have only one class project; we'll work together as a class to find something that interests everyone. For the present, I have structured the middle portion of the first semester around a tentative topic -- the history of water in Toronto.  
* Course Structure
** First Semester
In the first semester we will meet on a weekly basis to discuss the week's readings ("Readings" in the [[outline1][outline]]) and work together on a technical or interpretative task that will be defined in advance ("Lab" in the [[outline1][outline]]).  

Every two weeks, students will (where not otherwise noted) be expected to post blog responses to the readings in advance of the class meeting, and to respond to the postings of at least two other students.  If at all possible, you should bring your laptop or (not as good!) tablet to class for the lab portion.  

Also about once every two weeks, there are other types of assignments; these are noted in the outline and referred to in the course requirements.  In general the aim is to foster an atmosphere of collaborative and self-directed learning in which all work is focused on building the analytic resources, technical skills, and confidence to create really great projects in the second semester.  Though the assignment structure is fixed, readings may change based on student interests. The semester culminates with group presentations of your proposed projects.  

** Second Semester
In the second semester it is expected that students will spend most of their time working directly on their project with the partnering organization.  We will meet most weeks to discuss specific technical questions raised by the projects themselves, and will discuss additional readings as needed.  Importantly, students will continue to make regular postings about their progress, and comment on each other's writing.  Projects will be submitted to community partners for review in the second to last week of classes, presented to the class in the final course meeting, and handed in to the professor immediately before the beginning of finals period.  
* Course Requirements
# <<Course Requirements>>
In this project-based class, we have relatively few readings and instead focus on active learning through a variety of assignments, all of which are intended to help you build towards your final, collaborative group project.  

The class has 4 kinds of assignments:
- 16 Blog Postings   (6 in semester 1, 12 in semester 2, *20%*) 
- 5 "Short Technical Assignments"   (STA's, first semester, *15%*)
- One Written Paper  (7-9 pp, Jan 10, *10%*)
- The Final Project  (website, ongoing but due April 4, *45%*)
with the balance of 10% for on- and off-line participation, which includes comments on other students' blog posts, contributions to online resources, and discussion.

*Blog Postings* are thoughtful pieces, 400 words or so in length, posted to the course blog by noon the day before class meets (so, noon each Monday).  You will be expected to read your colleagues' postings and respond to them, both online (using the blog's comment function) and in class.  In the first semester, these postings will primarily be /responses to the weekly readings/, and are required /every two weeks/.  In the second semester, they will instead generally take the form of *weekly* (not bi-weekly) /progress reports/ in which you discuss your final projects and your interactions with partnering organizations, or of /short written pieces from your project site/ (see below). See the [[http://2015.hackinghistory.ca/assignments/the-course-blog/][assignment page]] for more details. 

*Short Technical Assignments (STA's)* are designed to give you the technical skills you will need for your website development work in the second semester.  Approximately every 2 weeks in the first semester, you will complete a short on or off-line assignment for a *pass-fail* grade.  The lab assignments will cover basic web skills and other technical topics, which will always have been covered in the third 'lab' hour of class. 

*The Paper* is due shortly after the beginning of the second semester.  Approximately 7-9 pages long, its format is that of a standard course paper:  a well-researched thesis, supported by evidence garnered from primary and secondary sources.  Students are expected to write on topics related to their *Final Projects* (see below).  

*The Final Project* is a major collaborative effort to build a historical website in service to an organization outside the University. In previous years, students have worked in groups of 3-4, collaboratively building a substantive site which balances scholarly merit with the interests of the sponsoring organization and accessibility to the general public. The plan for this year is in flux and may depend on class size, but I tentatively foresee a single class project in collaboration with a new initiative in the Black Creek region of Toronto (which includes Pioneer Village).  

See the [[http://www.hackinghistory.ca/assignments/class-project-overview/][Project Guidelines]] for more detailed discussion & marking breakdown, though that document does not yet reflect this year's direction..  
** Late Policy
*Blogs:* blog postings are due by noon /the day before class/. Late blog postings will not be marked.

*STA's:* no late papers! STA's are pass/fail, hand them in on time please.  

*Paper:* 3%/day.

*Final Project:* It is /essential/ that you complete your final project on time in order to get feedback from the sponsoring organization and organize the handoff of the project. The various deadlines for the project (see [[./ProjectGuidelines.org][Project Guidelines]]) are firm.  *DO NOT MISS THEM.*

* 'Outline' for  Semester 2
In the second semester, we will meet mostly to discuss your progress on the project and to address specific issues you are encountering as you work.  You will be working pretty intensively on research, design, and writing/creating, so we will usually /not/ have class readings, except in cases where a background reading will obvously be of assistance to most of the class in addressing some issue.  The particular topics we take on will be defined by your needs, but some potential ones include:
- Designing digital Projects
- Immersive History (games & Simulations)
- Refining your project goals
- Social Media in a community website (Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, etc)
- Data Capture and Metadata
- How Databases Work
- The Digital Divide: Design Implications
- Copyright Issues
- Accessibility
- Wordpress Content Types
- New HTML5 tags (canvas, audio/video, microformats)
- Video on the Web: HTML5 & dynamic events
- Semantic Web Technologies
- Audio Post-Processing
- Website look and Feel

** COMMENT dross                                                   :noexport:  
Our final meeting will be a Project Open House in which you share the final products of your labours with the class.

- More Toronto History
- Living Museums
- Responsive Design
