"In what ways can digital media and digital networks allow us to do our work as historians better?" -- Cohen & Rosenzweig

* _Introduction_ 
This year-long course examines the relationships among academic history, digital media, and community formation using a variety of texts and methods; it culminates in an intensive semester-long digital storytelling project focused on community engagement.  The intellectual focus of the first semester is two-fold: first, on the history of the public sphere and second, on the politics of "engaged" scholarship.  At the same time, students will be exposed to techniques of multimedia and nonlinear storytelling.  The second semester revolves around a group project undertaken in concert with a community organization.  Working closely with their community partners, students will build a digital archive or storytelling framework using multimedia and/or social networking technologies.  The fundamental aim of the course is to expand the reach of historical scholarship outside of the academy, and to develop modes of historical research compatible with community engagement.
* _Course Structure_
** First Semester
In the first semester we will meet on a weekly basis to discuss the week's readings ("Readings" in the [[Outline: Semester 1][outline]]) and work together on a technical or interpretative task that will be defined in advance ("Lab" in the [[outline1][outline]]).  In advance of the class meeting students will generally be expected to produce written responses to the readings in the form of blog postings, and to respond to the postings of at least two other students.  In certain weeks there are other types of assignments; these are noted in the outline and referred to in the course requirements.  In general the aim is to foster an atmosphere of collaborative and self-directed learning in which all work is focused on building the analytic resources, technical skills, and confidence to create really great projects in the second semester.  Though the assignment structure is fixed, readings may change based on student interests.
** Second Semester
In the second semester it is expected that students will spend most of their time working directly on their project with the partnering organization.  We will meet as needed, probably about every second week, to discuss specific technical questions raised by the projects themselves.  However, it is still expected that students will make regular postings about their progress, and comment on each other's writing.  In general, it is expected that the second-semester projects will also be collaborations.  
#<<Course Requirements>>
* _Course Requirements_
The emphasis will be on steady, consistent work.  Students are required to make weekly contributions to the online postings to the class website, and to comment on other postings.  There are also weekly technical assignments, which serve as the basis for the lab portion of the course.The second semester is largely taken up by the final project, which counts for 50% of the grade and in the course of which blog postings will continue to be required.  Grade distribution:
- online commentary 25%
- lab assignments 15%
- in-class participation 10%
- Final Project (including ancillary assignments) 50%
** Project Timetable
Sept. 16: Detailed assignment handed out with preliminary partner suggestions
Oct. 28: Presentation of preliminary project proposal.  
Dec. 2: Presentation of Final Proposal
Jan 10: Internship begins (approximate)
Feb 24: Intermediate Status Report
Apr. 7: Project Open House
** Grading of Posts and Labs
Posts and labs will be graded in the old-fashioned 0-4 system, where 0 represents and F and 4 an A.  The assignments will be summed and averaged, then converted to a UofT-style numerical grade.  
# <<texts>>
* _Texts_
