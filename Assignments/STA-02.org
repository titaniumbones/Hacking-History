When faced with massive amounts of data, we need ways, first, to find relevant information, and second, to organize it in such a way as to make it useful to us.  In this assignment, you will explore some methods to learn more about the Occupy Wall Street protests/movement that is currently underway.  

Answer each of these questions briefly, in approximately one paragraph.  Cite sources, and at the end describe what tools you used to discover those sources.  Hints in text.

* What is Occupy Wall Street?
What is "Occupy Wall Street, who organizes it, and what do they want?  Use a [[http://www.google.ca][simple google search]], though you may want to supplement it with a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois][whois]] [[http://whois.domaintools.com][query]] and a [[http://news.google.com][Google news search]].  

* What is the media reaction?
How would you characterize the media reaction to Occupy Wall Street? Here you will likely want to use some of the [[http://news.google.com/news/advanced_news_search?pz=1&cf=all&ned=ca&hl=en][advanced features]] of Google's news search, as well as some blog search engines.  

* Identify 2 prominent intellectuals who support Occupy Wall Street. 
By now you should already have some candidate names.  
- Use [[scholar.google.com][Google scholar]], [[http://www.library.utoronto.ca/][Scholar's Portal]] ('search for articles' on the library homepage), and/or [[http://apps.webofknowledge.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/WOS_GeneralSearch_input.do?highlighted_tab=WOS&product=WOS&last_prod=WOS&SID=4FjA1kebNjboFhIiMfH&search_mode=GeneralSearch][Web of Science]] to find some of their most important works.
- Use a citation search to figure out /who has most influenced them/; here, you will basically find the most prominent citations in their most important works; do this through Web of Science (first search for the article, then click on the link to view the citations), though you may need to download the full text of an article from [[http://www.jstor.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/action/showAdvancedSearch][JSTOR]] in order to figure out what citations are really important to the person.
- Now try to figure out /who they've influenced/.  You can do this through Web of Science or Google Scholar, but also by acting as your own human webcrawler, using e.g. any of several [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_search_engines#Blog][blog search engines]] (but also including [[http://www.google.com/blogsearch][Google's]]).
