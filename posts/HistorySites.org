OK, I see people aren't feeling especially enthusiastic about their sites (or anyway the assignment!) tonight.  To be sure we have something to talk about, here are a couple of sites I'd like you all to check out:

- [[http://mainstreet.lib.unc.edu/][Main Street, Calorlina]] is an umbrella project for local history projects in North Caroline.  Do you like it? What does and doesn't work about it? Would you wantto emulate some part of it in your project? And do you think the deficits can be overcome?
- [[http://www.viseyes.org/][VisualEyes Project]], especially [[http://www.viseyes.org/show/?base=vh][Vinegar Hill]].  Again, what do you think? What's the purpose of the site(s)? How do htey mobilize the power of the web (or fail todo so)?
- [[http://megaprojects.uwo.ca/][MegaProjects]].  And, once again: What's the aim, what's the effect, do you enjoy them?

See you in class.
