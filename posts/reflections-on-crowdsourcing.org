#+TITLE: Reflections on Crowdsourcing

THanks to everyone who posted on the topic of crowdsourcing.  Reading your blogs, it seems to me there are a few themes that recur, around which we should probably structure our conversation:

- "What constitutes a real historical practice?", as Marsden Brooks asks (thx to [[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/22/how-can-professional-historians-and-enthusiasts-work-together/][Mike]]).
- What to make of Wikipedia's NPOV requirement (thanks to [[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/23/can-history-be-crowdsourced/][Angelo]])
- relationship between crowdsourced history & professional history ([[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/22/open-source-projects-as-information-aggregators/][Kylie]], [[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/22/crowdsourcing-as-a-historians-tool/][Aidar]], [[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/22/post-on-crowdsourcing/][Jeremy C]])
- the strong case against crowdsourcing ([[http://2014.hackinghistory.ca/2014/09/22/the-pros-and-cons-of-open-source-projects/][Ken]] esp)
- Crowsdourcing and Community (this is my own primary interest in Owens' post)

Look forward to the discussion, in just a few minutes.
