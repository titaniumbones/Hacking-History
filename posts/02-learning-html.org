* Getting Started
If you have a computer, go straight to jsbin & fool around while I'm talking:

* How the web works
The web is written in a language called [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]]. The HyperText Markup Language provides a way for your browser to receive a stream of text and present that stream to you in a human-friendly format.  

Every web page is made up of many [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_elements ][HTML Elements]], which are joined together to make a unified whole.  Each element is composed of three main parts:
- an *opening tag*
- the *element content*
- a *closing tag*
Your browser looks for the opening and closing tags and interprets them as an instruction for displaying the element content.  
** Anatomy of a tag
- *Here is some bolded text*.  
Let's look at the code for this line.
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<b>Here is some bolded text</b>
#+END_SRC
The opening tag "<b>" tells your browser "apply bold to this element".  

The closing tag </b>tells the broswer where to /stop/ applying bold.

And the content is in this case obvious.
** Nested tags
A really important feature of HTML is that tags can be *nested* -- that is, you can have elements within elements.  So, for instance, the real code for that last line is:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<li>
<b>Here is some bolded text</b>. 
</li>
#+END_SRC
This says "Make a /list item/.  Then add some text in bold.  
** Some important tags
HTML is a rich language with many capabilities.  We can't possibly learn them all in class, and I myself forget many of them all the time.  But here are some of the most important:
- <p></p> identifies a /paragraph./
- <i></i> identifies /italic text./
- <b></b> identifies /bold text./
- <h1></h1> to <h10></h10> identify /headings/ of different levels.
- <a></a> defines a hyperlink
- the <img /> tag looks a little different, and identifies a special kind of link -- to an image that will be displayed /inline/, that is, within the web page.  
** HTML Attributes
- HTML tags are also allowed to have /attributes/.  These are additions to the opening tag that provide extra information. These can be used, for instance, to control the style in which an element is displayed:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<p align=right>Whoa! This paragraph displays way over to the right!</p>
#+END_SRC

But for some elements attributes are much more important than that
*** the href attribute
Every Hyperlink needs to have a /referent./ For this we *must* use the *href* attribute:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
#+END_SRC
*** the src attribute; height and width
The [[http://w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp][img]] tag looks a little bit different from most other tags, because it has no *element content*.  Instead, the opening tag already contains the closing tag.  So where's the content? It's in the attributes:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/JuergenHabermas.jpg" height=200px width=300px />
#+END_SRC
When linking to an image, we absolutely need to identify the /source/ of the image.  And it's almost always a good idea to identify the height and width as well, or a big image will take over your whole desktop.

#+ATTR_HTML: height=200px width=300px

* Hacking your way to HTML mastery!
** Tools!
- *View source.* When you right click on a web page in any modern browser, you will see a 'view source' option.
- *Hackasaurus.* Mozilla has a really neat new tool for kids that you might also find useful, claled "Hackasaurus X-Ray Goggles.  [[http://www.hackasaurus.org]]
- *jsbin*. The awesome real-time html/javascript previewer.
- *firebug/inspect element*.  The [[http://getfirebug.com/][firebug extension for firefox]] and [[https://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/overview.html][google Chrome's instpect element]] both let you mess with the code on any website you're looking at.  They're amazingly powerful.  
** Tutorials
- [[http://w3schools.com/][W3 Schools]] provides excellent tutorials.
- [[http://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-webcraft/#open_signup_projects][Mozilla's School of Webcraft]] is about to open
- [[http://hackbook.hackasaurus.org/][The Hackasaurus hackbook]] is another great place to start
