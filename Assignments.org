* Assignments for His 495: Hacking History
Assignments for HIS495 are linked here as I put them up on the site.   This mostly means lab assignments and documents related to the project, as the weekly writing assignments are straightforward reading responses (this is described in the [[./syllabus/][Syllabus]]).
