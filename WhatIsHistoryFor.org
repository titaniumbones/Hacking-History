* What Is History For?
What is the function of history?  
In this session we should talk about the public ufnctions of history; I need a sliel about narratives, meaning, creation of communal meaning, etc.  
Then after that talk about the public sphere, the Internet, what communities are, etc.  Will need to do some research in recent socialogy of technology and also back into the public-sphere discussions.  reading Chris's book essential.
