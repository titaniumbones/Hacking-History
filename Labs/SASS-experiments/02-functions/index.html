        Please change some of these colors.

      <div class="column fade-2">
        Can you make the text turn red?  green? yellow?  Here is a link. <a href="">link</a>.

      <div class="column fade-3">
        The font colors are all determined by a few variables.  Change the variable values and the colors change.      </div>

      <p>The output looks almost exactly the same, but if you compeare the last part of the ifle you'll see that somewthing a little cooler is going on.  the CSS for "fade-x" divs is being created programmatically ina simple loop.  Can you change some of the parameters and see what looks different? ></p> 
      <p>So, one function is difined right here I n the stylesheet, buttere are other functions that are ubilt in to SASS.  You can see them in a couple of places in the text.  </p>
