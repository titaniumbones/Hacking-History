* theming with wordpress
** Themes are collections of files
- they live in your wordpress install:

** Themes tell wordpress how to display your content

** Files in your theme
- *style.css:*  your stylesheet; you need this
- *functions.php:* you're going to need this too
- *index.php:* this is the default template for your theme; you can't live without it
- *header.php:* controls your header.
- *footer.php:* controls your footer area
- *sidebar.php:* generates your sidebar

** template hierarchy
remember this

** plugins and themes
- Themes control appearance
- plugins add funcionality
- but sometimes the difference isn't so clear
- check out required-foundation themes and r-* plugins.  They are interdependent

** Editing Your Theme
- install the [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpide/][wp-ide]] plugin to enable you to do syntax-highlighted code editing in your browser.  If the interface feels a little awkward try [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-file-editor/][better file editor]] instead -- it may be sufficient for our needs (I haven't experimented with it yet).
- try changing the 'powered-by' text in the footer to our starter theme.  Did yo umake it work? Did you (alternatively) break the Internet?
- I'll come up with some other ideas on the fly...
