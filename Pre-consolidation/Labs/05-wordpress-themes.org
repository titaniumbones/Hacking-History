** Themes are collections of files
- they live in your wordpress install:
[[file:~/HackingHistory/Images/wp-file-structure.jpg]]
** Themes are written primarily in PHP
PHP is a programming language developed specifically for writing web pages.  Most PHP files consist of HTML and PHP intermixed with each other. This can be a little confusing, but you will get used to it. We will puzzle through the PHP syntax together, but you might want to try the [[http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php][Codeacademy PHP track]] as an introduction to the language basics.  Knowing just a little will make your work a lot easier next semester.  

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php echo('Hello World'); ?>
#+END_SRC

** Themes tell wordpress how to display your content
[[http://pengbos.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wp.jpg]]

** Files in your theme
- *style.css:*  your stylesheet; you need this
- *functions.php:* you're going to need this too
- *index.php:* this is the default template for your theme; you can't live without it
- *header.php:* controls your header.
- *footer.php:* controls your footer area
- *sidebar.php:* generates your sidebar

** template hierarchy
remember this:

Here is a more detailed view:

[[file:~/HackingHistory/Images/Template_Hierarchy.png]]

When accessing a piece of data from the database, Wordpress will check in sequence to see if appropriate templates are available and use the first matching template it finds.  

** plugins and themes
- Themes control appearance
- plugins add functionality
- but sometimes the difference isn't so clear
- We will try to keep things pretty well-separated, but sometimes it's just much easier to do all your programming in a theme.  

** Editing Your Theme
- install the [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpide/][wp-ide]] plugin to enable you to do syntax-highlighted code editing in your browser.  If the interface feels a little awkward try [[http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-file-editor/][better file editor]] instead -- it may be sufficient for our needs (I haven't experimented with it yet).
- try changing the 'powered-by' text in the footer to our starter theme.  Did you make it work? Did you (alternatively) break the Internet?
- Check out functions.php, and then sidebar.php.  Can you understand what's going on?  It's not easy to understand!
- try editing the css enough so that you can get something un-hideous.
*** Headers
Right now there is no custom header support in our theme!  To use a header image,
add this code to functions.php:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php add_theme_support('custom-header); ?>
#+END_SRC


And put this somewhere in header.php: 

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<img src="<?php echo( get_header_image() ); ?>" alt="<?php echo( get_bloginfo( 'title' ) ); ?>" />

#+END_SRC 
** Learn much, much more
There is a huge amount of information online at the [[http://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_into_Templates][Wordpress Codex]].  That last link is a good starting point, and so is the [[http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development][Theme Development Page]].  There is lots and lots and lots to learn here...
